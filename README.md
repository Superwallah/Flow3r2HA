Make petals and LEDs on the badge accessible through HA

You need:
* a flow3r badge from the CCC camp: https://flow3r.garden
* a home assistant installation: https://www.home-assistant.io/
* an MQTT server, best as an add-on to home assistant
* all three in the same Wifi/LAN

See INSTALLATION.MD for details
